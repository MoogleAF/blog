    <h1>Hey, I'm Amine Flih</h1>
    <p>Welcome to week 2 of my 12 Web Apps in 12 Weeks Challenge.</p>
    <p>This week I built a blog in Rails 4. You're actually on the demo application right now. Cool stuff, right!.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to follow along as I learn more Ruby on Rails, find me on Github <a href="https://github.com/mo1988">Here</a> or through email <a href="a.flih@yahoo.com">Send me an Email</a></a>.</p>
